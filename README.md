# AI TASK ONE: CHATBOT WITH RULE-BASED RESPONSES
# Introduction:
The chatbot with rule-based responses project creates a simple conversational agent using Python. The chatbot interacts with users by responding to their messages based on predefined rules and patterns. This project provides an introduction to natural language processing and conversation flow in chatbot development.

# Code Explanation:
# Rules and Responses:
The chatbot's behavior is determined by a set of predefined rules and responses. Each rule is a regular expression pattern that matches specific user inputs, and the corresponding response is provided by the chatbot.

# Match Rule Function:
A function is defined to match user input with the predefined rules. It iterates through the rules and returns the response corresponding to the first matched pattern.
