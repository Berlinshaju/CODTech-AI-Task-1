# AI: CHATBOT WITH RULE-BASED RESPONSES
# Introduction:
The chatbot with rule-based responses project creates a simple conversational agent using Python. The chatbot interacts with users by responding to their messages based on predefined rules and patterns. This project provides an introduction to natural language processing and conversation flow in chatbot development.

# Code Explanation:
# Rules and Responses:
The chatbot's behavior is determined by a set of predefined rules and responses. Each rule is a regular expression pattern that matches specific user inputs, and the corresponding response is provided by the chatbot.

# Match Rule Function:
A function is defined to match user input with the predefined rules. It iterates through the rules and returns the response corresponding to the first matched pattern.

# Main Chat Function:
The main function handles user interactions, prompting users for input and providing responses from the chatbot. The conversation continues until the user decides to exit.

# Program Execution:
**Step 1:** The program starts by welcoming the user and prompting them to ask a question or say 'bye' to exit.

**Step 2:** The user inputs a query or message.

**Step 3:** The chatbot processes the input and provides a response based on the predefined rules.

**Step 4:** The conversation continues until the user decides to exit by typing 'bye', 'goodbye', or 'exit'.

# Conclusion:
The chatbot with rule-based responses project demonstrates a basic implementation of a conversational agent. By defining rules and responses, the chatbot can engage users in conversations on a variety of topics. However, it lacks advanced natural language processing capabilities and may struggle with complex queries or ambiguous input.

# AI: CHATBOT WITH RULE-BASED RESPONSES (GUI Implementation)
# Introduction:
The GUI implementation of the chatbot with rule-based responses project enhances the user experience by providing a graphical interface for interaction. Using Tkinter, a Python library for creating GUI applications, the chatbot's functionality is integrated into an intuitive interface, allowing users to engage in conversations more effectively.

# Code Explanation:
# Window Creation:
A GUI window is created using Tkinter, providing a platform for the chatbot interface.

# Program Execution:
**Step 1:** The program starts by creating a GUI window titled "Chatbot".

**Step 2:** Users can input messages in the entry field and press the "Send" button or press Enter to send the message to the chatbot.

**Step 3:** The chatbot processes the input and provides a response based on the predefined rules.

**Step 4:** The conversation history is displayed in the text area, allowing users to review previous interactions.

# Conclusion:
The GUI implementation enhances the user experience of the chatbot by providing a visually appealing and interactive interface. Users can easily engage in conversations with the chatbot through the intuitive graphical interface, improving accessibility and usability.
